### 🔍 Analysis

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| **Authorization** | Granted | ✅ PII clearance valid |
| **PII in Request** | 100% masked | ✅ LLM never sees raw PII |
| **PII in Response** | 100% masked | ✅ Double protection |
| **Audit Trail** | Complete | ✅ Provenance recorded |
| **Total Latency** | 7,110ms | ✅ Acceptable |

### 🛡️ Defense-in-Depth Validation

**Layer 1 (Input DLP)**: 
- ✅ SSN masked: `123-45-6789` → `***-**-****`
- ✅ CC masked: `4242424242424242` → `****-****-****-****`
- ✅ Email masked: `john@example.com` → `<email>`

**Layer 3 (Policy)**:
- ✅ User has `clearance=pii_approved`
- ✅ Policy rule: `allow if employee + pii_approved + sensitive`

**Layer 5 (Output DLP)**:
- ✅ Response re-scanned for PII
- ✅ Any leaked PII would be masked again
- ✅ Model-generated PII patterns caught
